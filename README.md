I had hear about this phenomenon and wanted to try it out for myself.

I start out with a random 'trace' point and an arbitrary number of 'corners'. On each iteration, the trace is moved to its midpoint with a random corner. This results in surprising fractal patterns. In the case of three points, it actually results in the point tracing out a Serpinski triangle.

If there are more than three corners, the additional constraint needs to be added that the trace cannot approach any corner more than once in a row. The patterns generated by this are interesting.
